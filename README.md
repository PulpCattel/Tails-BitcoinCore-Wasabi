**PROBLEMS TO SOLVE**

* Store keys, privacy-concern informations or wallets on low security system with lot of code.
* Be worried or stressed using your daily computer because it’s a delicate target. 
* Have a stationary setup, highly impractical if it’s necessary to use it outside its location. 


**TARGETS**

* Small and very well designed live OS.
* Safe new environment that leaves no traces and retains files only if explicitly request.
* Portable setup that can be started from almost any computer.


**ADDITIONAL TARGETS**

* Only-Tor inbuilt network.
* Isolated environment to manage private keys and highly valuable informations.
* Simple, little to no command line required.
* Low hardware requirements.


**INTRODUCTION**

Every program we are gonna use is free and open source software, my job here is mainly to arrange the different sources in a straightforward tutorial on how to recreate this setup. 

I’ll put quotes with step by step procedures. In the reference links you’ll find extensive explanations of every step, technical support and documentation.

As usual, don’t trust, verify!

If you care about these projects, I strongly encourage you to give a look at their websites and help contributing in any way.

**DISCLAIMER**

This guide is not meant for newbie users, even though the technical skills required are arguably low, instead mostly it aims at average users, that already care about privacy and security, that already experimented with wallets and full nodes and that maybe don’t know about Tails, live USB or how to do it in a straight way.

Ultimately, I’m sure a lot of people have more than enough competence to recreate this setup.
