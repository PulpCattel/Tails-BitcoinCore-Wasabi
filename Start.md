**WHY TAILS?**

*Tails is a live operating system that you can start on almost any computer from a USB stick or a DVD. It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to:*
* *Use the internet anonymously and circumvent censorship, all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor Network.*
* *Leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly.*
* *Use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.*

We can leverage inbuilt [features](https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/features/index.en.html) of Tails to create our separate and portable environment.

Tails has very low hardware requirements, namely:
* *8GB USB.*
* *A computer able to boot from USB.*
* *2GB RAM to work smoothly.*

And a very easy setup. Thus, it’s perfect for us.

:warning:
Tails is not a magic wand, take a careful look at the [warning page](https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html) and at the [documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html). No software can protect us from our own mistakes.


**WHY BITCOIN CORE?**

*Bitcoin Core is an open source project which maintains and releases Bitcoin client software called ‘Bitcoin Core’.*

*It is a direct descendant of the original Bitcoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published the famous Bitcoin whitepaper.*

*Bitcoin Core consists of both “full-node” software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a bitcoin wallet. The project also currently maintains related software such as the cryptography library libsecp256k1 and others located at GitHub.* 

*Anyone can contribute to Bitcoin Core.*

(Documentation: https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node)

Bitcoin core is the reference implementation of Bitcoin full node and the most reviewed.


**WHY WASABI?**

*Wasabi is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet, that implements trustless coin shuffling with mathematically provable anonymity - Chaumian CoinJoin.*

(Documentation: https://docs.wasabiwallet.io)

Wasabi allows us to use CoinJoin, it offers a wonderful PSBT implementation and by default does not send our public informations to their server (look at [BIP-158](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.html#what-are-bip-158-block-filters)).
