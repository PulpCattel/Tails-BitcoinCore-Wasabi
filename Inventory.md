# Inventory

**REQUIREMENTS**

* 32GB or higher USB drive (SD cards should work too). 
You can find some for less than 100k sats, obviously better hardware will work better. 
* A trusted computer to download and install Tails.
That's the most important part of the process, if your Tails.img is infected or corrupted, all the subsequent work will be severely compromised.
Do it in a safe location with a computer that you trust.
* Tails.img
from https://tails.boum.org/install/download/index.en.html.
Use great care to check that the file downloaded is the original Tails.img from the official site. 
As of now (Bitcoin's block 653435) this is the Tails PGP key fingerprint: `A490 D0F4 D311 A415 3E2B  B7CA DBB8 02B2 58AC D84F`.


**RECOMMENDED**

* Second device to follow instructions
